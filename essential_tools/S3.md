## What is S3?
In a nutshell, S3 a secure, HA storage  ! it's a safe place to store ur files [ object-based ] ( word documents, pitches .. )
P
S: S3 is not suitable for hosting ‘databases’ or ‘OSs’ 

- unlimited storage ( up to 5 TB )
- data spread across multiple facility/regions ( HA )
- data stored in buckets ( folders )
- Name of the S3 bucket must be UNIQUE ( S3 is a global service, not created in a specific region )

when u upload a file successfully to S3, u’ll get HTTP 200 response code

S3 is object based, and the Objects consist of the following variables:

- key : the name of the object
- value : the data
- version ID
- Metadata : data about data you’re storing
- subresources ( ACL, torrents ) : used to lock stored objects

* How does S3 keep ur data consistent? 

- Read over write consistency for PUTS of new objects ( if u upload a file ur able to read it immediately )
- For updating a file or deleting a file, changes are consistent as well

### S3 features:

- Tiered storage available
- lifecycle mgt ( if data is 2 years old, delet it … )
- versioning
- encryption
- MFA for deleting objects
- secure data using ACL  and bucket policies:

            -  bucket policies secure data at the bucket level 

            -  ACL secure data at the object level ( lowest level ) 

## S3 Storage classes:

### S3 standard:

- 99.99% availability
- 99.99999999999% durability ( eleven 9’s after ‘,’ )
- data stored is redundant across multiple devices in diff facilities and is desinged to sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently

### S3 Infrequent Access:

- used for data that is accessed less frequently but requires rapid acccess when needed; they’ have lower fees than S3

### S3 One zone - IA 

- lower-cost option for infreq accessed data / not resilient ( because data is not distributed across mulitple AZs )

### S3 - Intelligent Tiering 

- optimizes costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective access tier

### S3 Glacier 

- for data archiving / cheap

### S3 Glacier deep archive

- lowest-cost storage class ( retrieval time takes 12 hrs )


<pre>
S3 charges by:

1.) storage size

2.) number of requests

3.) storage management pricing (known as tiers)

4.) data transfer pricing (objects leaving/entering AWS via the internet)

5.) transfer acceleration (an optional speed increase for moving objects via Cloudfront)

6.) cross region replication (more HA than offered by default

</pre>

ADVICE:

- try to go w/ **S3- Intelligent Tiering** because it’s cheaper than **S3-Standard**
- If u dont worry abt data redundancy; go w/ S3 One zone - IA

### 

## S3 Versioning:

This feature is really awsome and useful if we have multiple versions of an app code and we wanna update it from one version to another .. 

## Lifecycle management:

- it automates moving your objects between the diff storage tiers, thereby maximizing cost effectiveness

( for exp, it moves data from S3 standard and after 30 days it moves it to S3 IA ) 

## S3 Object Lock

- Governance mode: during retention, users can’t overwrite or delete un object version or alter its lock settings unless they have special permissions ( this protects objects from getting deleted by users but we can grant some users permissions to allow them to delete users )
- Compliance mode: during retention, protected object versions can not be deleted or overwritten by any user ( even if u’r root user )

### A few key terms:
* Retention period:

it protects object version in a certain period of time

* Legal hold: 

It’s an S3 object lock that enables u to place a legal hold on an object version ( to keep other users from deleting it, "it is locked" ). 

Like a retention period, a legal hold prevents an object version from being overwritten or deleted however it doesn’t have an associated retention period and remains in effect until removed by the user 

[ the user must have s3:PutObjectLegalHold permission to be able to remove it ]

## S3 security and encryption:

- by default, all newly created buckets are PRIVATE
- you can setup access cntrl using: Bucket Policies & ACLs
- S3 buckets can be configured to create access log which logs all requests made to the S3 bucket and sends it to another bucket
- Encryption in transit is achieved by :

         - SSL/TLS 

- Encryption at Rest ( server side ) is achieved by :

         - S3 managed keys - SSE-S3

Types of encryption

- **Encryption in transit:** SSL/TLS .. HTTPS
- **Encryption at Rest ( server-side encryption )**

          -  SSE-S3 : performed by S3 service 

           - SSE-KMS: u work on amazon on ur own key management svc

           - SSE-C:  customer-provided keys ( u provide the keys )

- **Encryption at Rest ( client-side encrypt )** :  u encrypt Object on ur desktop then send it to S3 encrypted

How to enforce server-side encryption? 

- Console
- Buckete policy :

we must add x-amz ……….. permission in the request header:
